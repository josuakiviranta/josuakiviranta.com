          I&apos;m Josua - a product builder and a problem solver. When I&apos;m
          not doing projects, you&apos;ll find me doing cross-country skiing,
          following too many news sources or driving a camper van somewhere in
          Northern Europe. I&apos;m always looking for new meaningful projects
          with enthusiastic people. If you have an interesting project or you
          just feel like saying hi, don&apos;t hesitate to contact me.
        </p>
